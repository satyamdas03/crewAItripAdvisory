over here i am going to document the steps that i have followed..and i am not using readme file, cause i dont want

steps:
1) setting up the environment 
    --> we are going to setup our pyproject.toml this is basically going to turn all the requirements of our project into code
    so that we can just run our install script basically to package and build all the necessary dependencies to run our python application
    
    --> we are gonna have to install poetry  ==> pipx install poetry
    --> before installing poetry, we are gonna need to install pipx ==> use : py -m pip install --user pipx
    --> we have to create our own pyproject.toml file
        --> there are 2 key components that needed to be set up first one is "tool.poetry" in which we need to define the core components such as the "name", "description"
        --> the other one is the dependencies where we are going to specifically call out which package conversions we need to set up crew
        all of the necessary stuff is written in the project.toml file
        -->tool.pyright is going to allow us to check python codes for type errors
        -->tool.ruff is going to check for errors and also styling issues
        -->build-system is going to poetry version 

2) next step is to open up the terminal and do "poetry install --no-root"

3) poetry env list --> to check the currently used Python version for your Poetry environment with

4) poetry shell --> enter into the poetry environment  
        # after this we will have a python environment in which we can work in
